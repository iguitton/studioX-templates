<strong>Multiple Column Separators</strong>
====================================================
This template shows how to set multiple column separators. This is a very basic scenario where for some reason, each line has a different separator, perhaps due to the merging of several files, or any other reason that may come to mind. In the Dynamic Instance monitor, we have configured all of these separators so that our data output could be separated properly.
