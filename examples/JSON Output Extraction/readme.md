<strong>JSON Output Extraction</strong>
====================================================
This template shows how to monitor the output of a JSON file, then capturing specific objects for monitoring. We first capture the output of the JSON file, then we pass it through JSON Pre-Processing, which will convert it to a csv format. From here, we can create multiple instances, and extract specific objects using Value Map monitors, Numeric Extractions, etc.
